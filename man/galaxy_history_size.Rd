\title{Get the disk usage / size of a Galaxy history}
\usage{
galaxy_history_size(
  history_id,
  galaxy_url = "https://usegalaxy.eu",
  include_deleted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{history_id}{Galaxy history id (required)}

\item{galaxy_url}{Base URL of the Galaxy instance (default: "https://usegalaxy.eu")}

\item{include_deleted}{Logical; whether to include deleted datasets when summing (default FALSE)}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns history_id, bytes, human_size
}
\description{
The function first tries to read a size/disk_usage field from the history
summary endpoint. If that is not present it fetches the history contents
and sums dataset sizes (robust to a few different field names used by
different Galaxy versions). Results are returned as a data.frame with
bytes and a human-readable size.
