\title{Poll a Galaxy workflow invocation until completion}
\usage{
\S4method{galaxy_poll_workflow}{character}(
  x,
  galaxy_url = "https://usegalaxy.eu",
  poll_interval = 30,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A workflow invocation ID (\code{character}) or a \code{Galaxy} object.}

\item{galaxy_url}{Base URL of the Galaxy instance, used by the character
method. If \code{GALAXY_URL} is set it takes precedence.}

\item{poll_interval}{Time in seconds between polling attempts.}
}
\value{
For the character method, a list with elements \code{success} and
\code{output_ids}. For the \code{Galaxy} method, the modified \code{Galaxy} object.
}
\description{
\code{galaxy_poll_workflow()} is an S4 generic. With \code{x} as a character vector it
is treated as a workflow invocation ID; the invocation is polled until it
completes and a list of output dataset IDs is returned. With \code{x} as a
\code{\link{Galaxy}} object, the \code{invocation_id} and \code{galaxy_url} are taken from the
object, and the object is updated with the resulting \code{output_dataset_ids} and
state.
